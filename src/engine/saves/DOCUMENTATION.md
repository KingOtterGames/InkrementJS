In order to add a new version, you will need to do the following:

1. Create new version file in the versions/ folder
2. Import it in the index.ts
3. In the versions function in index.ts, do any compatability requirements (things you wanna add/remove)
4. In the constants folder, update the state.ts file with the new version
