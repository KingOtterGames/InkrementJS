In order to add a new version, you will need to do the following:

1. Create new version file in this directory
2. Import it in the saves.ts file under the engine directory
3. Add the version conversion function to the "version" function in the save.ts file under the engine directory
4. Update the CURRENT_VERSION, DEFAULT_SAVE, and DEFAULT_SAVE_TYPE in that saves.ts file
